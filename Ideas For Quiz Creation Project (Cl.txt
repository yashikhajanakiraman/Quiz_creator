Ideas For Quiz Creation Project (Club Celestius)

General Format:
1. Login / SignUp
2. Design a Quiz by specifying the number of questions
3. Attend the Quiz
4. Result will be given after the quiz

Things to Note:

1. Are we doing a test based quiz (User answers the questions, then the score and correct answers are revealed at the end)
2. Or are we doing a quiz where correct answers and explanations are displayed after solving that one question?
